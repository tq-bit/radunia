# Radunia components

This Vitepress documentation serves static Vue.js components, sample code and snippets. Each of these may or may not be used in the Radunia project.

To be frank, this is just my personal Alzheimer website, if you stumble across it, feel free to browse through.



## Components

Components are grouped by purpose. Each resides in its own directory
